# NOTE:
# Dailymotion does no longer support using this JS SDK for "Player"
# integration and should only be used for interaction with the Data API
# The Player can be embedded with any of our embed methods that can be
# found at: https://developers.dailymotion.com/player.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:
# The LATEST Dailymotion SDK (2024-04-02) does NOT work. Changes of 2024
# seems the API to break, most probably  for the  Sunset player API.
# For now, the previous version of 2022-10-18 is used.
